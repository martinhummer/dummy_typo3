SetEnv TYPO3_CONTEXT Development
#####
#
# Example .htaccess file for TYPO3 CMS - for use with Apache Webserver
#
# This file includes settings for the following configuration options:
#
# - Compression via TYPO3
# - Settings for mod_rewrite (URL-Rewriting)
# - PHP optimisation
# - Miscellaneous
#
# If you want to use it, you have to copy it to the root folder of your TYPO3 installation (if its
# not there already) and rename it to '.htaccess'. To make .htaccess files work, you might need to
# adjust the 'AllowOverride' directive in your Apache configuration file.
#
# IMPORTANT: You may need to change this file depending on your TYPO3 installation!
#
# Lines starting with a # are treated as comment and ignored by the web server.
#
# You should change every occurrence of TYPO3root/ to the location where you have your website in.
# For example:
# If you have your website located at http://mysite.com/
# then your TYPO3root/ is just empty (remove 'TYPO3root/')
# If you have your website located at http://mysite.com/some/path/
# then your TYPO3root/ is some/path/ (search and replace)
#
# You can also use this configuration in your httpd.conf, but then you have to modify some lines,
# see the comments (search for 'httpd.conf')
#
# Questions about this file go to the matching Install mailing list, see
# http://typo3.org/documentation/mailing-lists/

### Begin: Compression via TYPO3 ###

# Compressing resource files will save bandwidth and so improve loading speed especially for users
# with slower internet connections. TYPO3 can compress the .js and .css files for you.
# *) Uncomment the following lines and
# *) Set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['compressionLevel'] = '9' for the Backend
# *) Set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['compressionLevel'] = '9' together with the TypoScript properties
#    config.compressJs and config.compressCss for GZIP compression of Frontend JS and CSS files.

#<FilesMatch "\.js\.gzip$">
#	AddType "text/javascript" .gzip
#</FilesMatch>
#<FilesMatch "\.css\.gzip$">
#	AddType "text/css" .gzip
#</FilesMatch>
#AddEncoding gzip .gzip

### End: Compression via TYPO3 ###


### Begin: Browser caching of ressource files ###

# Enable long browser caching for JavaScript and CSS files.

# This affects Frontend and Backend and increases performance.
# You can also add other file extensions (like gif, png, jpg), if you want them to be longer cached, too.

<FilesMatch "\.(js|css)$">

	<IfModule mod_expires.c>
		ExpiresActive on
		ExpiresDefault "access plus 7 days"

### Begin: Settings for mod_rewrite ###

	# - $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['versionNumberInFilename']

	RewriteRule ^(typo3/|t3lib/|fileadmin/|typo3conf/|typo3temp/|uploads/|favicon\.ico) - [L]

	# Redirect http://example.com/typo3 to http://example.com/typo3/index_re.php and stop the rewrite processing.

### Begin: PHP optimisation ###

# If you do not change the following settings, the default values will be used.

# TYPO3 works fine with register_globals turned off.
# This is highly recommended, if your web server has it turned on.
